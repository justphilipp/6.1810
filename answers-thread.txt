The reason is concurrent insert could likely cause lost updates.Suppose there are threads t1 and t2. Here is a scenario of lost update. T1 get bucket1's head, then t2 also get bucket1's head. They all make their new entry point to head. If they all finish that operation, and then all write their address to table arrays, there must be one overwritten by the other. That's the reason why lost updates happen.
